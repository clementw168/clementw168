# ðŸ‘‹ Who am I ? 

Hi, Iâ€™m Clement Wang. I was born in Paris with Chinese parents. I've lived in Paris all my life so whenever I go out, I'm really excited to discover new things. 

# ðŸ‘€ What do I like to do ? 

As a human being, I have some hobbits ! 


## Coding and AI

I did not start to code while being really young. In fact, I discovered algorithmic in my first year of high school during a maths course. From that moment, I started to feel so powerfull with a computer. I started to code in Basic Casio on my Casio calculator. Then I learnt to code in C because of a friend of mine. I really liked coding but I felt like it was much to easy so I prefered studying maths. Then I really started to code after two years of CPGE when I finally got into an engineering school. Then I found out how much fun it was to code, especially code AIs. 

## Sports 

I really like doing sports, like running, playing basketball and volleyball. 

## Animes 

First one, I'll start with animes. Animes played a huge role in my existence. When I was a child (well, I still am a child but I've grown up a bit), I was not able to blend in because I was too big-headed to fit in. So yeah, I used to watch animes, hundreds of animes.
