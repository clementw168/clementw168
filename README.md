# ðŸ‘‹ Who am I ? 

Hi, Iâ€™m Clement Wang. I was born in Paris with Chinese parents. I've lived in Paris all my life so whenever I go out, I'm really excited to discover new things. 


## Coding and AI

I did not start to code while being really young. In fact, I discovered algorithmic in my first year of high school during a maths course. From that moment, I started to feel so powerfull with a computer. I started to code in Basic Casio on my Casio calculator. Then I learnt to code in C because of a friend of mine. I really liked coding but I felt like it was much to easy so I prefered studying maths. Then I really started to code after two years of preparatory courses when I finally got into an engineering school. I did not like maths as much as before but when I found out about AI, I finally found something exciting enough to make me think for hours without any particular reason. 

## Sports 

I really like doing sports, like running, playing basketball and volleyball.
