<summary><h4> Student projects </h4></summary> 
<br>

![CentraleSup√©lec banner](/assets/banners/CS-saclay.png)

As a student, I was still not sure what I wanted to do in my life. After a Bachelor in maths, physics and algorithmics and I got into one of the best university of France. That's when I started to try out different things...

<summary><h5> Game Jam: 3D Horror Game </h5></summary>

My very first group coding project with a team of 5 people. We designed and developed a 3D Horror Game on Unity in C# within 1 week.

I mainly worked on the interactions with the environment, the fighting gameplay and mobs' behavior.

You can download the game [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QAxTDq3LyYiQcaBdpUdU7sxK0e0sgb4l/view?usp=drive_link).

![Photo of our robot](assets/images/croc_1.jpg)  |  ![Photo of the playground](assets/images/croc_2.jpg)

Building an autonomous robot that moves in a defined environment and move objects within a team of 11 people in about one year.

We had a fixed camera outside of the game board. I worked on the localization of the robot and the detection of the objects and obstacles from the camera and the transmission of this information.

<summary><h4> Automatants, AI student organization </h4></summary>

![Automatants banner](assets/banners/automatants-banner.jfif)

Automatants is the AI student organization of CentraleSup√©lec. It promotes Machine learning at CentraleSup√©lec, gathering skills and sharing knowledge through courses, events, competitions and projects. 

<details>
<summary><h5> President of the association </h5></summary>
<br>
From January 2021 to January 2022, I was the President of this student organization. It was probably the most fulfilling experience of my life. 20 people, tens of events, competition and so much fun.

Here are some images:

<summary><h5> GAN: Cat generator  </h5></summary> 
<br>

Generated cats|
:-----:|
![Generated cats](assets/images/gan.png)|

This was my very first Deep learning personal project. The goal was to generate cat images. I got a dataset from the internet and I took my very first step in Deep learning.

I started with a simple DCGAN, then a GAN with residual connexions, changed the loss to a Wasserstein loss and at the end I trained Progressive GAN. I read the papers for Style GAN but did not implement it.

To make it public, I served it on the website of my association with Tensorflow JS. Try it [here](https://automatants.cs-campus.fr/projects/cat-generator).

<summary><h5> Perceptual loss: Neural Style Transfer  </h5></summary> 
<br>

TODO: images

After GANs, I got hooked into perceptual losses. The idea of designing a "perceptual loss" instead of using a pixelwise loss so interesting that I had to implement it. 

After implementing the vanilla version of neural style transfer, I wanted to have a quicker method to get stylish images so I implemented fast neural style transfer. I consists in using a generator network to directly transform an image to minimize the perceptual loss. I managed to transfer style in real-time from my camera.

<summary><h5> Imbalanced classification </h5></summary>

:-----:|
![Quickdraw Dataset](assets/images/quickdraw.jpg)|

Winning a competition on imbalanced image classification. This competition was the occasion to apply everything I learned in one year.

My best model was an ensemble of MobileNetv2 nets trained with semi-supervised learning and a lot of regularization (label smoothing, drop out, weight decay).

[Here](https://github.com/clementw168/Imbalanced-Quickdraw) is the repository of my code for more details.

<summary><h5> Genetic algorithm for mazes </h5></summary> 
<br>

Visualization of the game|
:-----:|
![Image of the game](assets/images/genetic-maze.png)|

This project solves a maze game only knowing the distance to the exit. When the game begins, the player has to provide a list of moves (right, left, top, right). Then the environment returns the distance to the exit after following the list of moves. 

I used a genetic algorithm to solve this game only for the sake of having fun with a genetic algorithm.

The corresponding repository is [here](https://github.com/clementw168/Genetic-Maze)

<summary> A few facts about me </summary> 
<br>

- I was born Asian, grew up in a French environment and chose to be an international guy.

- I am a sports addict: volleyball, bouldering, spikeball, running, biking...
- There is no fun if I don't aim for the best. Being competitive brings so much and it is ok not to be the best. 
- I love both spending my time reading philosophy in a silent park and partying with friends.
- One day, I was playing basketball to cool down after an exam. I slipped on a clementine and broke my ankle. Then I walked with crutches for 2 months.
